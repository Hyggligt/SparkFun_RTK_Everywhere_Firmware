During WiFi configuration, the RTK device will present a webpage that is viewable from either a desktop/laptop with WiFi or a cell phone. For advanced configurations, a desktop is recommended. For quick in-field changes, a cell phone works great.

## RTK Torch

To get into WiFi configuration follow these steps:

1. Power on the RTK Torch
2. Once the device has started press the Power Button twice within 1 second (double tap).
3. The display will beep twice indicating it is waiting for incoming connections.
4. Connect to WiFi network named ‘RTK Config’.
5. You should be automatically re-directed to the config page but if you are not, open a browser (Chrome is preferred) and type **rtk.local** into the address bar.

Note: Upon connecting, your phone may warn you that this WiFi network has no internet. That's ok. Stay connected to the network and open a browser. If you still have problems turn off Mobile Data so that the phone does not default to cellular for internet connectivity and instead connects to the RTK Device.

Clicking on the category 'carrot' will open or close that section. Clicking on an ‘i’ will give you a brief description of the options within that section.

Please note that the firmware for the RTK device and the firmware for the GNSS receiver is shown at the top of the page. This can be helpful when troubleshooting or requesting new features.

## File Manager

On devices that support an external SD card, a file manager is shown if an SD card is detected. This is a handy way to download files to a local device (cell phone or laptop) as well as delete any unneeded files. The SD size and free space are shown. And files may be uploaded to the SD card if needed.

Additionally, clicking on the top checkbox will select all files for easy removal of a large number of files.

## Saving and Exit

Once settings are input, please press ‘Save Configuration’. This will validate any settings, show any errors that need adjustment, and send the settings to the unit. The page will remain active until the user presses ‘Exit to Rover Mode’ at which point the unit will exit WiFi configuration and return to standard Rover mode.
